/*Practical 13
Write a Prolog program to implement two predicates evenlength(List) and oddlength(List) so that they are true if their argument is a list of even or odd length respectively.*/

/*Practical 14
Write a Prolog program to implement nth_element (N, L, X) where N is the desired position, L is a list and X represents the Nth element of L.*/
nth_element(1, [X|_], X).
nth_element(K,[_|L],X):-
	nth_element(K1,L,X),
	K is K1+1.
